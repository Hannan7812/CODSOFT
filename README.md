# CODSOFT
This is the repository which contains the tasks required to complete my codsoft internship. All  the tasks are described briefly below:

## Task 1: Titanic survival prediction
In the first task we were provided the famous titanic dataset and were required to build a model which would predict the outcome of the passengers. This project used matplotlib for visualizations, pandas for data handling and sci-kit learn for machine learning algorithms.

## Task 2: Sales Prediction
In the second task we are given a dataste consisiting of advertisement and sales indices. The goal is to create a model which can predict the amount of sales given the indices of advertisement on various platforms. This project also used matplotlib for visualizations, pandas for data handling and sci-kit learn for machine learning algorithms.
